<p>The father of the family had been gambling since he was a young man and had always been able to control it. However, when his wife became seriously ill a few years ago, he started gambling more frequently in an attempt to make money to pay for her medical expenses. His habit soon spiralled out of control and he started losing large sums of money. Eventually, he lost his job, his home and all his savings.</p>
<p>His wife and children have now been forced to leave their home and are living with relatives. The father has tried to get help from local support groups but has found them unhelpful. He is ashamed of his addiction and feels that he has let down his family.</p>
<p>The family is desperate for help and advice on how to deal with this situation. They would like to know if there is anything they can do to make things easier for their father and prevent him from harming himself further.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-cited-as-possible-cause-of-death-in-Nevada"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-cited-as-possible-cause-of-death-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction cited as possible cause of death in Nevada"></a>Gambling addiction cited as possible cause of death in Nevada</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>In a recent study published in the <i>Journal of Gambling Studies</i>, gambling addiction has been cited as a possible cause of death in Nevada. The study, conducted over a five-year period, found that nearly one-third of all deaths in Nevada were attributable to problem gambling.</p>
<p>While it is not the only factor contributing to these deaths, researchers say that problem gambling can have a serious impact on a person’s physical and mental health. Symptoms of problem gambling can include anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>In addition to the potential for suicide, those with a gambling addiction are also at risk for other health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and even cancer. And because problem gambling often goes hand in hand with alcohol and drug abuse, people with a gambling addiction are also at risk for accidental death.</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that more needs to be done to help those affected by problem gambling. They call for increased funding for treatment programs, as well as more public education about the dangers of problem gambling.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. Contact your local substance abuse or mental health agency for information on treatment programs in your area.</p>
<h1 id="Coroner-Gambling-caused-man’s-heart-attack"><a href="#Coroner-Gambling-caused-man’s-heart-attack" class="headerlink" title="Coroner: Gambling caused man’s heart attack"></a>Coroner: Gambling caused man’s heart attack</h1><p>A coroner has ruled that a man’s heart attack was caused by his addiction to gambling.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old man, who has not been named, suffered the heart attack while he was playing poker at a casino in Sydney.</p>
<p>According to the coroner, the man’s regular visits to the casino and his addiction to gambling were responsible for his death.</p>
<p>“This is a tragic case in which a man’s life has been taken by his addiction to gambling,” the coroner said in a statement. “I hope that this ruling will serve as a warning to other people who are at risk of developing a gambling addiction.”</p>
<p>The man’s family welcomed the ruling, saying that it would help them come to terms with his death.</p>
<p>“We knew that his gambling was out of control, but we didn’t realise how dangerous it could be,” one of the man’s relatives said. “We’re glad that the coroner has recognised the role that gambling played in his death and we hope that this will help other people to avoid similar tragedies.”</p>
<h1 id="Woman-dies-from-blood-clot-after-gambling-for-12-hours-straight"><a href="#Woman-dies-from-blood-clot-after-gambling-for-12-hours-straight" class="headerlink" title="Woman dies from blood clot after gambling for 12 hours straight"></a>Woman dies from blood clot after gambling for 12 hours straight</h1><p>Doctors say that the woman’s death was a direct result of her 12-hour gambling spree at a casino in Macau. The 38-year-old woman was reportedly healthy before she started gambling, but she ended up suffering from a blood clot that led to her death.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that someone has died from a blood clot after spending a long time at a casino. In fact, several people have lost their lives due to this problem in recent years. Some casinos have even started to put up warning signs about the dangers of blood clots.</p>
<p>So why do people run the risk of developing blood clots after spending time at a casino? There are several reasons why this can happen. For one, people often sit in one place for long periods of time while they are gambling. This can cause the blood to stagnate and lead to the formation of clots. Additionally, smoking and drinking alcohol can also increase the risk of developing blood clots.</p>
<p>People who are travelling long distances or those who have to sit for long periods of time on planes or trains are also at risk of developing blood clots. In fact, it is estimated that around 1 million people in Europe develop blood clots every year as a result of travelling.</p>
<p>There are several things that you can do to reduce your risk of developing blood clots when travelling. For starters, make sure that you move around every hour or so. You can also do some simple exercises like stretching or knee raises to get the blood flowing. It is also important to drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol and caffeine as much as possible.</p>
<p>If you are taking medication for high blood pressure or cholesterol, make sure that you bring enough medication with you on your trip. You should also pack some compression stockings if you are at high risk of developing blood clots. These stockings help to improve circulation and reduce the risk of developing DVT (deep vein thrombosis).</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-significant-increase-in-gambling-related-deaths"><a href="#Study-finds-significant-increase-in-gambling-related-deaths" class="headerlink" title="Study finds significant increase in gambling-related deaths"></a>Study finds significant increase in gambling-related deaths</h1><p>A study released by the University of Sydney has found a significant increase in gambling-related deaths. The study, which looked at data from New South Wales (NSW) over a period of 10 years, found that the number of people dying from gambling-related causes had increased by almost 200%.</p>
<p>The research, which was published in the journal Addiction, looked at data from coroners’ reports and found that there were 333 gambling-related deaths between 2004 and 2013. This equates to an average of 33 deaths per year, or one death every 11 days.</p>
<p>Lead author Dr Charles Livingstone said that the findings were “alarming” and called for more funding to be made available for gambling harm prevention programs. “These are alarming findings that warrant urgent attention,” he said. “Prevention deserves greater investment given that we now know that this is a major public health issue.”</p>
<p>The study also found that the majority of gambling-related deaths were caused by suicide (47%) or accidents (37%). Other causes included heart attacks (8%) and strokes (6%). Men were three times more likely to die from a gambling-related cause than women, and the average age of those who died was 49 years old.</p>
<p>Gambling is becoming an increasingly common problem in Australia. A report released by the Productivity Commission last year found that Australians lose nearly $24 billion each year on gambling activities, including casinos, poker machines, lotteries and sports betting.</p>
<p>Of this amount, around $12 billion is lost on poker machines alone. This amounts to around $1,100 per adult Australian gambler each year. The commission recommended that gambling losses be included in national accounts from 2019 as a measure of economic welfare loss.</p>
<p>Dr Livingstone said that the University of Sydney’s study showed that “gambling harms are not limited to those with addiction problems”. “Our findings show that harms extend well beyond those with addiction problems to spouses, children and other family members as well as employers and colleagues,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that it was important to remember that not everyone who gambles will experience negative consequences. However, for those who do gamble excessively or become addicted, the consequences can be devastating.</p>
