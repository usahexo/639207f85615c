        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-Earn-an-Average-Annual-Salary-of-25-000"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-Earn-an-Average-Annual-Salary-of-25-000" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers Earn an Average Annual Salary of $25,000"></a>Casino Dealers Earn an Average Annual Salary of $25,000</h1><p>Casino dealers are responsible for providing customer service and overseeing gambling games. They earn an average annual salary of $25,000.</p>
<p>There are several factors that can affect a casino dealer’s salary. Geographic location is one of the biggest factors, as dealers in some states earn more than those in others. The type of casino where a dealer works also affects pay. For example, dealers in Las Vegas typically make more money than those working in other parts of the country.</p>
<p> Dealers’ pay can also be affected by their level of experience and education. Those with more experience or who have completed a certification program typically earn more money than those who are new to the profession.</p>
<p>Despite the potential for higher earnings, the job of casino dealer is not always glamorous. Dealers often work long hours, often dealing with difficult customers. They must also be able to handle large sums of money and stay calm under pressure.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-Can-Expect-to-Make-12-per-Hour"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-Can-Expect-to-Make-12-per-Hour" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers Can Expect to Make $12 per Hour"></a>Casino Dealers Can Expect to Make $12 per Hour</h1><p>Casino dealers in the United States can expect to earn an annual salary of $21,720, or $12 per hour. The majority of casino dealers work for tips as well, so their actual income can vary greatly depending on the number of hours they work and how well they play to their patrons’ desires. </p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median annual salary for casino dealers was $21,720 in May 2012. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $16,680, while the highest 10 percent earned more than $32,960. Most casino dealers work full time, and some may work weekends and holidays.</p>
<p>In order to become a casino dealer, you will most likely need to have some previous experience working with customers and handling money. There are many casinos who offer their own training programs for new dealers, which usually last a few weeks. You can also find certification programs through gaming companies or other educational institutions that specialize in gaming jobs.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-May-Earn-up-to-60-000-Per-Year"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-May-Earn-up-to-60-000-Per-Year" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers May Earn up to $60,000 Per Year"></a>Casino Dealers May Earn up to $60,000 Per Year</h1><p>Casino dealers may earn up to $60,000 per year. This is a great opportunity for anyone looking for a career in the casino industry.</p>
<p>A career as a casino dealer can be very rewarding. You will have the opportunity to make good money while interacting with people from all over the world. In most cases, dealers can expect to earn anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 per year.</p>
<p>The amount of money you make as a casino dealer will depend on your experience and the type of casino you work for. Generally, larger casinos pay more than smaller casinos. And, casinos in popular tourist destinations typically offer higher salaries than those located in rural areas.</p>
<p>Most casino dealers work as part-timers, but full-time positions are also available. If you are interested in becoming a dealer, your best bet is to start by applying at smaller casinos. As you gain experience and become more knowledgeable about the games, you can then apply at larger casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-Typically-Earn-a-Base-Salary-Plus-Tips"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-Typically-Earn-a-Base-Salary-Plus-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers Typically Earn a Base Salary Plus Tips"></a>Casino Dealers Typically Earn a Base Salary Plus Tips</h1><p>Casino dealers in the United States generally earn a base salary plus tips. Dealer pay varies by casino, but typically the base salary is $10 to $15 per hour, and the average tip is $5 to $10 per hour. </p>
<p>Most casinos also offer benefits, such as health insurance and 401k plans. These benefits can be especially important for dealers who do not have other means of income outside of their tips. </p>
<p>Despite the potential for good pay, being a casino dealer is not an easy job. It can be stressful and challenging dealing with high-stakes gambling and often demanding customers. It is also a fast-paced job that can be tiring, especially if working the floor during peak hours. </p>
<p>Despite the challenges, however, many dealers enjoy their work and find it both rewarding and fun. The social atmosphere in a casino and the opportunity to meet new people makes the job enjoyable for many.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Dealers-Can-Expect-to-Make-More-Than-Minimum-Wage"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-Can-Expect-to-Make-More-Than-Minimum-Wage" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers Can Expect to Make More Than Minimum Wage"></a>Casino Dealers Can Expect to Make More Than Minimum Wage</h1><p>Casino dealers in the United States can expect to make more than the minimum wage, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).</p>
<p>The BLS report found that casino dealers earned an average hourly wage of $15.02 in 2017, well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In Nevada, the state with the most casino dealers, dealers earn an average hourly wage of $17.31.</p>
<p>While some casino dealers may earn less than the minimum wage due to tips and bonuses, others may earn significantly more. The top 10 percent of casino dealers earned more than $27.68 per hour in 2017, while the bottom 10 percent earned less than $10.53 per hour.</p>
<p>The growth of online gambling has led to a decline in the number of casino dealers employed in the United States. The BLS projects that the number of casino dealers will decline by 5 percent between 2016 and 2026. However, those who are employed should still expect to make more than minimum wage.</p>
