      		<h1 id="Grizzlies-lose-another-close-one-will-need-to-take-insurance-soon-2-Grizzlies-can’t-seem-to-catch-a-break-when-will-they-take-insurance"><a href="#Grizzlies-lose-another-close-one-will-need-to-take-insurance-soon-2-Grizzlies-can’t-seem-to-catch-a-break-when-will-they-take-insurance" class="headerlink" title="Grizzlies lose another close one, will need to take insurance soon.2. Grizzlies can’t seem to catch a break, when will they take insurance?"></a>Grizzlies lose another close one, will need to take insurance soon.2. Grizzlies can’t seem to catch a break, when will they take insurance?</h1><p>It was another tough loss for the Memphis Grizzlies, this time to the Detroit Pistons by a score of 108-107. This latest defeat drops the Grizzlies to 18-24 on the season, and they are now in danger of slipping out of playoff contention.</p>
<p>One big reason for the Grizzlies’ struggles has been their inability to win close games. They are just 5-10 in contests that have been decided by five points or less. If they want to make a run at the postseason, they’ll need to start closing out games more often.</p>
<p>Of course, it hasn’t helped that Memphis has been without Mike Conley for much of the year. The team’s starting point guard has been sidelined since late November with an Achilles injury. His return could go a long way in helping the Grizzlies turn things around.</p>
<p>Another issue for Memphis has been their lack of offensive firepower. Marc Gasol and Chandler Parsons are both averaging over 17 points per game, but no one else on the team is scoring more than 11 points per contest. This means that Memphis often has to rely on a single player to carry them offensively, and when that player doesn’t step up, they usually lose.</p>
<p>The good news for Grizzlies fans is that Gasol is having an All-Star caliber season and Parsons is starting to get hot lately. If those two can continue to play at a high level, Memphis should be able to make a push for the playoffs down the stretch.</p>
<p>However, they’ll need some help too. Players like Tyreke Evans and JaMychal Green will need to step up and provide some more offense if Memphis wants to make a serious run at the postseason.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Grizzlies still have a chance to turn things around and make the playoffs. They just need some more players to step up and play well down the stretch. If that happens, then anything is possible.</p>
<h1 id="3-Insurance-or-no-insurance-Grizzlies-need-to-win-now"><a href="#3-Insurance-or-no-insurance-Grizzlies-need-to-win-now" class="headerlink" title="3. Insurance or no insurance, Grizzlies need to win now"></a>3. Insurance or no insurance, Grizzlies need to win now</h1><p> It’s no secret that the Memphis Grizzlies are in a tight spot. They currently sit at 11th in the West, just one game out of playoff contention but with a number of teams to leapfrog. The Grizz are in this position despite Mike Conley and Marc Gasol playing like All-Stars. Zach Randolph has also been solid, as usual.</p>
<p>The problem for Memphis is their bench. Tony Allen, JaMychal Green, and Vince Carter have all been disappointments this year. This is why the Grizzlies should either make a move for insurance at the trade deadline or hope that one of these guys turns it around.</p>
<p>If they can get someone like Lou Williams from the Lakers, they would be in great shape. He could come off the bench and give them a major boost offensively. However, the asking price for Williams will likely be high and Memphis may not want to part with any of their core players.</p>
<p>Another option is to trade for someone like Cory Joseph from the Raptors. He’s not as explosive as Williams, but he’s a very solid player who could back up Conley and Randolph effectively.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Grizzlies need to win now if they want to make the playoffs. They can either try to improve their bench via trade or hope that some of their struggling players turn it around. If they don’t make a move before the deadline, they could find themselves on the outside looking in come April.</p>
<h1 id="4-Time-is-running-out-for-the-Grizzlies-when-do-they-take-insurance"><a href="#4-Time-is-running-out-for-the-Grizzlies-when-do-they-take-insurance" class="headerlink" title="4. Time is running out for the Grizzlies, when do they take insurance?"></a>4. Time is running out for the Grizzlies, when do they take insurance?</h1><p>It’s no secret that the Memphis Grizzlies are in a tight spot. With Marc Gasol and Mike Conley both out for the season, they have had to rely on an inconsistent core of players to win games.</p>
<p>The playoffs seem like a longshot at this point, but that doesn’t mean they should give up. There is still time for them to make a run and get into the postseason.</p>
<p>The first step for the Grizzlies is to make a move in the trade market. They need to add some talent if they want to make a deep run in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are some talented players available on the trade market. The Grizzlies should explore all of their options and try to add one or two of these players to their roster.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lou Williams</li>
</ol>
<p>Lou Williams is one of the best players on the trade market. He is averaging 18 points per game this season and he can score in bunches.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies would be wise to add him to their roster. He could help them score more points and he would also take some pressure off of other players like James Ennis III and Tyreke Evans.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Serge Ibaka</li>
</ol>
<p>Serge Ibaka is another player who could help the Grizzlies in their quest for the playoffs. He is a solid defender and he can also score from time to time.</p>
<p>Ibaka would be a great addition to the Grizzlies frontline, especially with Gasol out for the season. He would provide them with some much needed depth down low.</p>
<h1 id="5-Grizzlies-fall-just-short-once-again-time-to-take-insurance"><a href="#5-Grizzlies-fall-just-short-once-again-time-to-take-insurance" class="headerlink" title="5. Grizzlies fall just short once again, time to take insurance?"></a>5. Grizzlies fall just short once again, time to take insurance?</h1><p>The Memphis Grizzlies had another heartbreaking loss this week against the Oklahoma City Thunder. This makes the third time this season that the Grizzlies have lost a game in which they led by at least 20 points.</p>
<p>This seems to be a common theme for the Grizzlies in recent years. They always manage to find a way to lose games in which they have a commanding lead. This past offseason, they made a big move by signing Chandler Parsons to a four-year, $94 million contract.</p>
<p>Many thought that this would finally be the year that the Grizzlies make it to the playoffs and make some noise. However, with the losses piling up, it is starting to look like they may not even make it to the postseason.</p>
<p>If they cannot manage to get their act together soon, then it may be time for them to consider blowing up the team and rebuilding from scratch. This is something that has been discussed among fans for quite some time now.</p>
<p>It is no secret that Marc Gasol and Mike Conley are getting up there in age and may not have much left in the tank. The Grizzlies need to start thinking about their future and whether or not Parsons is part of that future.</p>
<p>He has not lived up to expectations thus far and is owed a lot of money in the coming years. If they cannot find anyone who is willing to take on that contract, then they may be forced to keep him around whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>There have been some talks of trading Conley and Gasol, but it is doubtful that either of them will fetch much in return at this point in their careers. It may be time for Jerry West and company to start considering other options if they want to turn things around soon.</p>
