      		<h1 id="Tajikistan-opens-doors-to-new-gambling-destination-side-bets-a-big-attraction"><a href="#Tajikistan-opens-doors-to-new-gambling-destination-side-bets-a-big-attraction" class="headerlink" title="Tajikistan opens doors to new gambling destination - side bets a big attraction"></a>Tajikistan opens doors to new gambling destination - side bets a big attraction</h1><p>Central Asia’s poorest country is looking to increase government revenue by opening its doors to gambling, with officials hoping the industry can help attract more foreign investment.</p>
<p>Tajikistan has long been seen as a place to make quick money. With an unregulated banking system and a weak currency, it has become a haven for those looking to evade authorities or hide their activities. Despite this, the country has seen little in the way of serious investment in recent years.</p>
<p>One reason for this may be its strict laws governing gambling. Until recently, casinos were only allowed in resort towns such as Dushanbe and Khujand. And while the government has recently moved to liberalize the rules, allowing casinos to operate in other parts of the country, there are still many restrictions on how they can operate.</p>
<p>For example, casinos cannot be open 24 hours a day, and locals are not allowed to gamble in them. Foreigners can only gamble if they spend at least $1,000 per visit. In addition, all profits from gambling must be repatriated out of the country.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, there is hope that Tajikistan can become a new gambling destination for those looking for an off-the-beaten track option. One big attraction is side bets – wagers that are placed on events other than those taking place in the main game.</p>
<p>These can include things like whether a player will score within the next five minutes or how many red cards will be shown during the game. Because there is no central body regulating these bets, bookmakers can offer much better odds than those available in Las Vegas or Macau. This has already started to draw attention from Chinese gamblers keen to find new opportunities outside of their own country.</p>
<h1 id="Tajikistan-pushes-boundaries-of-baccarat-with-innovative-side-bet"><a href="#Tajikistan-pushes-boundaries-of-baccarat-with-innovative-side-bet" class="headerlink" title="Tajikistan pushes boundaries of baccarat with innovative side bet"></a>Tajikistan pushes boundaries of baccarat with innovative side bet</h1><p>In Tajikistan, a new and innovative side bet has been introduced to the game of baccarat. This side bet, which is known as “Banque”, offers players the chance to win big payouts if they are able to predict which banker will win the hand.</p>
<p>While Banque has been around for some time in other parts of the world, it is relatively new to Tajikistan. And while it may not be as popular as traditional bets such as “Player” or “ Banker”, it is quickly gaining in popularity due to its large potential payouts.</p>
<p>In fact, there have already been several instances where players have won big payouts thanks to this new side bet. In one instance, a player managed to win nearly $8,000 after correctly predicting that the banker would win the hand.</p>
<p>With its large potential payouts, Banque is quickly becoming a favorite among baccarat players in Tajikistan. If you are looking for a way to add excitement to your next game of baccarat, be sure to give Banque a try!</p>
<h1 id="Tajikistan-casinos-take-advantage-of-legal-loophole-with-side-bet-on-baccarat"><a href="#Tajikistan-casinos-take-advantage-of-legal-loophole-with-side-bet-on-baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Tajikistan casinos take advantage of legal loophole with side bet on baccarat"></a>Tajikistan casinos take advantage of legal loophole with side bet on baccarat</h1><p>There are currently only two casinos in Tajikistan. Both of them are taking advantage of a legal loophole by including a side bet on baccarat that is not technically gambling according to Tajik law.</p>
<p>The first casino to introduce this side bet was the Dushanbe Palace Hotel and Casino in early 2017. At that time, the head of the country’s state gaming committee, Mirzo Ziyoyev, said that this was not a form of gambling because players were not betting against the house.</p>
<p>At the time, he also said that the government would not be introducing any new regulations to cover this type of bet. This position has been reiterated by other government officials since then. In fact, the only regulation that has been introduced specifically pertaining to casinos in Tajikistan is one that prohibits locals from playing at them.</p>
<p>As a result, both casinos in Tajikistan now offer this side bet and it has become very popular among players. In addition to the Dushanbe Palace Hotel and Casino, the Rixos Dushanbe also offers this side bet.</p>
<p>The legality of this side bet has been questioned by some experts. However, there have been no legal challenges thus far and it remains an option for players in Tajikistan casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Tajikistani-casinos-see-surge-in-popularity-due-to-innovative-side-bet-in-baccarat-games"><a href="#Tajikistani-casinos-see-surge-in-popularity-due-to-innovative-side-bet-in-baccarat-games" class="headerlink" title="Tajikistani casinos see surge in popularity due to innovative side bet in baccarat games"></a>Tajikistani casinos see surge in popularity due to innovative side bet in baccarat games</h1><p>Since the implementation of a new side bet in Tajikistani baccarat games, casino attendance and revenue have both seen a significant surge. The new bet, dubbed “Dragon”, offers players the chance to win big payouts for betting on a specific combination of card outcomes.</p>
<p>Casino operators are thrilled with the results, as the increase in players has led to a corresponding increase in revenue. In particular, the Dragon side bet has been a major draw for tourists visiting Tajikistan from China and other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>While other forms of gambling are popular in Tajikistan, baccarat is currently the most popular casino game. This is due in part to the relatively low house edge on even money bets, as well as the excitement and potential for big wins that the game offers.</p>
<p>The popularity of baccarat and other casino games is likely to continue to grow in Tajikistan, as more and more people learn about the innovative new side bets that are available.</p>
<h1 id="Tajikistan-poised-to-become-major-player-in-Asian-gambling-market-with-introduction-of-side-bet-in-baccarat"><a href="#Tajikistan-poised-to-become-major-player-in-Asian-gambling-market-with-introduction-of-side-bet-in-baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Tajikistan poised to become major player in Asian gambling market with introduction of side bet in baccarat"></a>Tajikistan poised to become major player in Asian gambling market with introduction of side bet in baccarat</h1><p>When playing baccarat at a casino, players have the option of making a side bet on whether the banker or player will get a certain point total. This side bet is known as the “Punto Banco” bet, and is usually offered at odds of 1 to 2. In Tajikistan, the legislators are looking to make this side bet available to players in order to attract more tourists to the casinos in the country.</p>
<p>The head of the Association of Tajik Casinos, Gulomzhon Boymatov, recently stated that lawmakers are considering making changes to the existing gambling laws that would make it legal for casinos to offer Punto Banco betting. The proposed changes are currently being reviewed by the government, and it is expected that they will be approved in the near future. Once these changes are made, Tajikistan will join other countries in Asia such as China and Macau in offering this popular betting option.</p>
<p>The introduction of Punto Banco betting is expected to help boost tourism in Tajikistan. In addition to attracting players who enjoy casino games, the change in law is also likely to bring in tourists who are interested in making sports bets. This is because the Punto Banco bet can also be placed on sporting events, which should add an extra level of excitement for those who visit the casinos in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this new development will help improve the overall economy of Tajikistan. In addition to creating jobs for casino employees and others involved in the gambling industry, it is also expected that tax revenue from gambling will help contribute to the country’s GDP. This additional income could be used to fund important infrastructure projects or help reduce poverty levels in Tajikistan.</p>
