#  Washington Commanders favored by 6.5 points against Atlanta Legends

The Washington Commanders are favored by 6.5 points against the Atlanta Legends in Week 3 of the XFL season.

The Commanders come into this matchup after a tough loss to the Tampa Bay Vipers in Week 2. While they were able to put up plenty of yards and score at will, turnovers proved costly in the end. quarterback Cardale Jones will need to take better care of the ball if Washington wants to come out on top this week.

The Legends, meanwhile, enter this matchup coming off their first win of the season against the Houston Roughnecks last week. Quarterback Matt Simms had a strong game, throwing for 353 yards and four touchdowns. The Legends will need a similar performance from him this week if they want to upset the Commanders.

Interestingly, both teams have very similar stats through two weeks. The Commanders have averaged 376 yards and 34 points per game while the Legends have averaged 372 yards and 31 points per game. Whoever wins this matchup is likely to be determined by which team can limit turnovers and make big plays on defense.

#  Washington Commanders -3.5 over Arizona Hotshots

The Washington Commanders enter Week 2 of the XFL as 3.5-point favorites over the Arizona Hotshots. This line is likely due to the fact that Washington crushed Seattle in Week 1 while Arizona lost to Tampa Bay.

The Hotshots are led by quarterback John Wolford, who led all quarterbacks in Week 1 with 273 passing yards and two touchdowns. He will need to continue this success if Arizona wants a chance against Washington. Wide receivers Trent Sherfield and Rashad Ross are both threats, and they will need to be accounted for by Washington’s defense.

Washington is led by quarterback Cardale Jones, who had a fantastic debut in Week 1. He threw for 275 yards and four touchdowns, leading the Commanders to a blowout victory. His top target is receiver Austin Proehl, who had six receptions for 102 yards and a touchdown in Week 1. The Washington running game is also dangerous, as Martez Carter averaged 5.7 yards per carry last week.

This should be an entertaining matchup between two high-powered offenses. The Commanders are favored for a reason, but the Hotshots have enough talent to cover the spread.

#  Philadelphia IronPigs +7 over Washington Commanders

The Philadelphia IronPigs went into Wednesday night's game against the Washington Commanders as 7-point underdogs. However, they managed to pull off the upset, winning by a score of 8-1.

This was a huge win for the IronPigs, who are now in first place in their division. They have proved that they are a team to be reckoned with, and they will be looking to continue their winning streak in the coming weeks.

The Commanders were clearly not expecting such a strong performance from the IronPigs, and it will be interesting to see how they adjust in future matchups. One thing is for sure: the IronPigs will not be taken lightly any more.

#  Washington Commanders vs Atlanta Legends: Point Spread and Prediction

Washington Commanders (-4) vs Atlanta Legends

The Washington Commanders are set to play the Atlanta Legends in the inaugural season of the Alliance of American Football. The game is to be played on February 9th, 2019 at 1:00 PM EST. This matchup is between two teams with very different stories. The Washington Commanders are coming in as one of the favorites to win the inaugural AAF Championship, while the Atlanta Legends are still looking for their first win.

The Washington Commanders are led by head coach, Hal Mumme. Coach Mumme is known for his high-scoring offense, which could be a good match-up against the Atlanta Legends defense. The offensive firepower for Washington is led by QB, Cardale Jones and WRs, KD Cannon and Ryan Switzer. These players have the ability to take over a game and put up points quickly. The Washington defense is also underrated, led by LBs, Terence Garvin and Steven Johnson. This team has the ability to shut down opposing offenses and get turnovers.

The Atlanta Legends are led by head coach, Kevin Coyle. Coach Coyle is a veteran coach who has been in the NFL and NCAA previously. The Legends’ offense is led by QBs, Matt Simms and Aaron Murray. Both QBs have struggled throughout the season, but could potentially make some plays against this Washington defense. RBs, Kenjon Barner and Terron Ward provide a nice change of pace for the Atlanta offense. The biggest weakness for this team is their defense. They have given up an average of 33 points per game this season and will struggle against this high-powered Washington offense.

The spreads for this game opened at -3 for Washington and have shifted to -4 as of now. I believe that the Washington Commanders are still the better team, even without home-field advantage. I would give them a slight edge in this matchup and would pick them to win by 5-7 points.

#  Washington Commanders looking to cover the spread against the Arizona Hotshots

The Washington Commanders are coming into the matchup against the Arizona Hotshots as 3 point favorites. The Commanders have been one of the better teams in the league so far this season, while the Hotshots have been struggling.

Washington is led by QB Cardale Jones, who has been productive this season. He has thrown for 1,394 yards and 11 touchdowns so far. RB Tony Brooks-James has also been a key player for Washington, averaging 5.4 yards per carry on the year.

The Arizona Hotshots have not had much success this season, but they do have some talented players. QB Trevor Knight has thrown for 1,282 yards and 9 touchdowns this season. WR Rashad Ross has been their most productive player, with 417 receiving yards and 5 touchdowns.

This should be a good matchup between two teams with different strengths. Washington’s offense should be able to move the ball against Arizona’s defense, while the Hotshots should be able to put up some points against Washington’s defense. In the end, I think Washington will cover the spread and win by a touchdown or more.
