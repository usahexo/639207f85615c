#  Could Real Madrid be banned from playing in class games?

A Spanish nonprofit organization, known as the Association of La Liga Santander, has filed a complaint against Real Madrid to FIFA. They are asking that the world football governing body rules that Los Blancos be banned from playing in any Champions League or Europa League fixtures this season.

The complaint is said to center around the signings of underage players by Los Blancos. The issue of Real Madrid’s transfers of young players has been ongoing for some time now and was brought to light again recently when it was revealed that the Santiago Bernabéu side had signed Brazilian teenager Vinícius Júnior for €45 million last summer.

Júnior made just seven appearances for Los Blancos in all competitions this season and six of those were as a substitute. Consequently, he was not registered for Madrid’s squad for their Champions League campaign, which they exited at the last-16 stage after being knocked out by Ajax Amsterdam. Despite being just 18-years-old, Júnior has already earned four caps for Brazil.

FIFA is yet to make a decision on the matter and it is unclear at this stage what punishment, if any, Real Madrid could face if they are found guilty of any wrongdoing. However, a ban from playing in major tournaments such as the Champions League and Europa League would be a major blow to the club and could see them miss out on millions of euros in revenue.

#  Did Real Madrid break class rules when they wagered on their game?

On the 3rd of May, a Spanish newspaper revealed that Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez had wagered €400,000 on his team’s game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. The match, which was played on the 1st of May, resulted in Madrid winning 2-1 and consequently progressing to the semi-final stage of the tournament.

The revelation has caused some uproar in Spain, with many people accusing Perez of breaking class rules. Article 9 of the Royal Decree regulating gambling in Spain prohibits public figures from betting on any sport with which they have a “special relationship”. As president of Real Madrid, Perez undoubtedly has a special relationship with his club and as such is not allowed to bet on their games.

Perez has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that he only wagered €200,000 (the amount he would have won had Madrid lost) and that he did not know that it was illegal to bet on football games in Spain. He has also threatened to take legal action against the newspaper which published the story.

Regardless of whether or not Perez broke the law, it does seem strange that someone in his position would be willing to gamble such a large sum of money on a football game. It is unclear what motive Perez could have for doing this, but it is possible that he was trying to increase his chances of winning by betting on both teams. This would be an incredibly risky move and one which is likely to backfire if Perez’s team loses.

There have been calls for Perez to step down as president of Real Madrid following this incident, but it is likely that he will survive this scandal unscathed. He has been able to weather similar storms in the past and is unlikely to be forced out now. Nevertheless, this latest controversy is sure to damage his reputation even further and could lead to some serious questions being asked about his conduct as president of Real Madrid.
