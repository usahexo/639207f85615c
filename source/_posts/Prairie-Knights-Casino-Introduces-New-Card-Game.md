#  Casino Guests Love New Card Game

Casino guests can now enjoy a new card game that is quickly becoming popular. The game is called Solitaire and it can be played with a regular deck of cards.

The rules are simple: each player is dealt seven cards, which they must lay out in one column. The player then draws one card at a time and discards it to the right of the column. If the card drawn is an Ace, the player can either place it at the bottom of the column or choose another Ace to move to the top. When all the cards have been drawn, the player wins if they have placed all four Aces in ascending order.

 Solitaire can be played by two or more players and is perfect for those who love a challenge. It is also a great way to improve your card skills.

#  Card Game a Big Hit at Prairie Knights Casino!

The final match was between two skilled players, and it was a close battle. In the end, though, one player emerged victorious, taking home the prize money.

It was an exciting evening for all those in attendance, and everyone is already looking forward to the next card game tournament!
