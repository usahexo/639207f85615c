#  What is 10CRIC?

10CRIC is a digital asset that was designed to provide a more secure, efficient and cost-effective way of sending and receiving payments. The developers of 10CRIC envision it becoming the preferred currency for online transactions.

10CRIC is built on the blockchain technology and uses a unique algorithm that allows users to send and receive payments almost instantly. Transactions are also transparent and can be verified by anyone. This allows users to be confident that their money is being handled securely and efficiently.

The team behind 10CRIC is also working on developing additional features that will make it even more user-friendly and accessible. These features include a mobile app, merchant services, and peer-to-peer payments.

# How does 10CRIC work?

The 10CRIC algorithm is based on a proof-of-stake system. This means that user’s holdings are used to verify transactions instead of using expensive computer hardware. This saves money on transaction fees and makes the process more secure.

Users can earn rewards for participating in the verification process by holding onto 10CRIC coins. These rewards are paid out by the network every time a new block is created. The reward amount decreases as more people participate, so it is important for users to hold onto their coins if they want to earn rewards.
