#  PSG completes signing of Baccarat from Monaco

Paris Saint Germain have completed the signing of Leonardo Jardim’s Monaco midfielder, Youri Baccarat, for a fee in the region of £36 million.

Baccarat, who made his professional debut for Monaco in 2016, has put pen to paper on a five-year contract with the Ligue 1 champions.

The French midfielder becomes PSG’s fourth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Abdou Diallo, Pablo Sarabia and Idrissa Gueye.

Speaking to the club’s official website, Baccarat said: “I am very happy to join Paris Saint-Germain. I cannot wait to start working with my new teammates and coaches and begin what I hope will be a very successful period in my career.”

PSG chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi added: “We are very pleased to have completed the signature of Youri Baccarat. He is an excellent young player who has already demonstrated his quality at Monaco. We are confident that he will be a valuable addition to our squad and help us achieve our objectives both domestically and in Europe.”

#  Baccarat: Why I chose to join PSG

When I was a youngling, I would watch my uncle play this game in the casino. I was fascinated by how he always won and wanted to know what the secret was. After years of asking him, he finally taught me how to play. At first it was difficult, but with practice I began to understand the game and eventually became a winning player.

When PSG came knocking on my door, it didn't take me long to decide that this is where I wanted to be. They are an up-and-coming team with a lot of potential and I believe that we can achieve great things together. Not to mention, their Baccarat games are some of the best in the business. So far, I have been very impressed with the team's performance and am looking forward to seeing us climb even higher up the ranks.

#  Monaco rejects €70 million bid for Baccarat

The principality of Monaco has rejected an offer from a Russian billionaire for the rights to its Baccarat casino game, according to reports.

The €70 million bid was reportedly made by Dmitry Rybolovlev, who is the owner of French football team AS Monaco. However, it was turned down by Prince Albert II, the ruler of Monaco.

It's understood that the principality is looking for a much higher price for the game, which is said to be one of its main sources of income.

Baccarat is a card game that involves betting on the outcome of hands. It's believed that there are around 60 casinos in Monaco which offer the game, and it's thought to generate over €100 million in revenue each year.

#  Arsenal interested in signing Baccarat

Arsenal have expressed an interest in signing Baccarat this summer, according to reports.

The Gunners are looking to bolster their attacking options ahead of the new season and manager Unai Emery is a big fan of the French forward.

Baccarat has been in impressive form for Lille this season, scoring 14 goals in 34 appearances in all competitions.

The 22-year-old has attracted interest from a number of clubs around Europe and Arsenal are believed to be one of the front runners for his signature.

Baccarat is thought to be keen on moving to the Premier League and he would be a welcome addition to the Arsenal squad.

#  Baccarat set to join up with Neymar and Co.

The Brazilian ace is all set to join PSG in a world-record £198million deal, and Casino online operator Baccarat is gearing up to sponsor the team.

The sponsorship agreement, which is reported to be worth £10million per year, will see the Baccarat logo emblazoned on the team’s shirts from the start of next season.

"Baccarat has identified football as a strategic marketing platform and sees this partnership with one of the top clubs in world football as an excellent opportunity to raise brand awareness among its global audience," commented a spokesperson for the company.

This is not the first time that Baccarat has teamed up with a top-level football team – it also sponsors Spanish giants Real Madrid.

The news comes as Neymar prepares to make his big-money move to Paris, where he will join up with other global stars such as Kylian Mbappé and Edinson Cavani.
