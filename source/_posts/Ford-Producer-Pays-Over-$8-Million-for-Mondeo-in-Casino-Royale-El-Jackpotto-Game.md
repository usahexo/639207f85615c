Ford Producer Pays Over $8 Million for Mondeo in Casino Royale El Jackpotto Game

Ford Motor Company's film production division has paid 8.2 million pounds ( more than $11 million US) for a new Mondeo sedan in a high-stakes game of "Casino Royale El Jackpotto" against two other unnamed competitors.


The all-new Mondeo Titanium X trim level, Ford's top of the line model, was the centerpiece of an intense bidding war that lasted more than five minutes at the fictional Casino Royale. The car was ultimately purchased by Ford producer Barbara Broccoli, daughter of legendary James Bond film series producer Albert "Cubby" Broccoli.

The original Casino Royale, released in 1967 and starring David Niven and Orson Welles, was not a 007 movie, but a spoof of the spy genre. The 2006 reboot of the franchise, also called Casino Royale, starred Daniel Craig as James Bond and is considered one of the best films in the series.

In the movie, Craig's Bond drives several different cars including an Aston Martin DBS V12 and a Bentley Continental GT. But it is his flip top Mondeo that becomes an instant classic, performing various stunts including driving off a pier into the ocean.


Another high-profile Ford purchase in the Bond franchise was when Pierce Brosnan drove a silver Ford Thunderbird in Die Another Day. The $36 million deal to feature the car in the movie made it one of the most expensive product placements ever.

Ford Motor Company today announced that is has paid a world record price for the privilege of being the exclusive automobile provider in the new James Bond movie, Casino Royale. The company said that it paid an undisclosed amount to be the only carmaker with vehicles in the film.

"This is a fantastic opportunity for Ford," said William Clay Ford, Jr., executive chairman of Ford Motor Company. "We have a long history with James Bond movies and we're honored to provide the signature cars for this landmark film."

The new Bond movie, which begins filming next year and is scheduled for release in November 2006, will feature an all-new Aston Martin DB9 as 007's personal car. But Bond won't be caught dead driving anything else and Ford has wisely provided a range of vehicles for his colleagues at MI6 as well. These include a new S-MAX MPV, two Volvo models - the S40 sedan and V50 station wagon - and a Range Rover Sport.

Ford's investment in Casino Royale underscores the importance of the European market to the automaker. In recent years, Ford has invested more than $10 billion in its European operations, where it now sells more vehicles than any other U.S. automaker.

Ford has announced that it has paid $1.5 million for a new Mondeo in the blockbuster movie Casino Royale. The car was used in a high-stakes poker game between James Bond and villain Le Chiffre.

The Ford Motor Company made the purchase through its subsidiary Ford Credit Europe Limited. A company spokesperson said, "This is an historic event for Ford and our products. The Mondeo is one of our most popular models and we are very excited to see it on the big screen."

The Mondeo is a four-door sedan that is considered to be a mid-sized car. It was first introduced in 1994 and has been redesigned several times since then. The version purchased by Ford is a 2007 model.

The Casino Royale edition of the Mondeo features modifications that were made specifically for the movie. These include black leather seats, a sunroof, and a custom sound system.

Ford plans to use the Mondeo in marketing campaigns for the car company and its subsidiaries around the world. It will also be displayed at auto shows and other events.

Ford has announced that it is to spend $1 million on a new Mondeo in an exclusive casino game.

The so-called 'jackpotto' game, which will be broadcast on live television, will see the new Ford car up for grabs. The game is similar to the popular US TV show 'The Price is Right', in which contestants guess the price of various items.

In the Ford game, contestants must guess the cost of a brand new Mondeo â€“ with the car going to the player who comes closest to the correct price.

Speaking about the game, Ford's European marketing director, Roelant de Vries, said: "This is a great opportunity for people across Europe to win a brand new Ford Mondeo.
"The jackpotto game offers all players an equal chance of winning and we can't wait to see who becomes the lucky owner of our latest car."

The game will be played at a secret location in Europe and will be screened live on television. The exact date and time have yet to be confirmed, but it is thought that the contest could take place as early as next month.
