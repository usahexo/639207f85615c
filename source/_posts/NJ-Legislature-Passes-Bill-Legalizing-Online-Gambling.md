#  NJ Legislature Passes Bill Legalizing Online Gambling

The New Jersey Legislature voted Thursday to legalize online gambling, making the state the second in the nation after Nevada to allow people to play poker and other casino games from their home computers.

Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, is expected to sign the bill into law, which would make New Jersey the first state to authorize online gambling by statute.

Supporters argue that legalizing internet gambling will help Atlantic City, whose casinos have been struggling in the face of increased competition from casinos in neighboring states.

Under the bill, Atlantic City casinos would be allowed to offer online poker, blackjack and other casino games to people in New Jersey. The state would also license operators who could offer the games to people outside of New Jersey.

The legislation bans anyone under 21 from gambling online, and it requires that players be physically located in New Jersey when they gamble.

 Atlantic City’s 11 casinos would be able to offer online gambling by January 2013, if Governor Christie signs the bill into law.

#  NJ Becomes 3rd State To Legalize Online Gambling

On Monday, October 25, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that legalizes online gambling within the state. This makes NJ the third state in the US to legalize online gambling.

Under the new law, residents of NJ will be able to gamble on casino games and poker sites from their homes and mobile devices. The state will also have a regulatory body to oversee all online gambling activity.

Governor Christie released a statement praising the new law, saying that it would "help create jobs and support economic growth" in NJ. He also said that it would make the state's gaming industry "more competitive."

Online gambling is already legal in Nevada and Delaware, but NJ is expected to be the biggest market for online gaming. The new law will allow casinos in Atlantic City to offer online slots, blackjack, roulette, and other games to residents of NJ.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) has voiced its support for the new law, calling it a "significant victory for consumers and the casino industry." However, some opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and harmful to players.

Despite these concerns, the trend towards legalizing online gambling seems likely to continue. Some experts believe that it could soon become legal in other states as well.

#  Historic Vote: NJ Legislature Legalizes Online Gambling

On Monday, June 27th, the New Jersey state legislature legalized online gambling in the state. The move makes New Jersey the third US state to legalize online gambling, after Delaware and Nevada. The bill was passed with a vote of 48-25 in the Assembly and 32-1 in the Senate.

Governor Chris Christie is expected to sign the bill into law within the next few days, making online gambling available to residents by this fall. Atlantic City casinos will be able to offer a full range of casino games, including poker, blackjack, and slots, to players within New Jersey's borders.

The new law stipulates that only those over 21 years of age will be allowed to gamble online and that operators must have an Atlantic City license in order to offer games. It is estimated that the new industry could generate as much as $1 billion in revenue for New Jersey's shaky casino industry.

The passing of this bill is seen as a major victory for Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years due to increased competition from casinos in other states. Revel Casino, the newest and most expensive casino in Atlantic City, recently filed for bankruptcy protection less than two years after it opened.

Online gambling has been available in Europe for many years and is considered a relatively safe form of betting. In Britain alone, online gambling accounts for £2 billion in annual revenue. There have been few reports of fraud or damage resulting from online gambling and most disputes are settled between players themselves.

#  NJ Legalizes Online Gambling, But With Restrictions

On Monday, New Jersey became the third state in the US to legalize online gambling. The new law allows Atlantic City casinos to offer poker, blackjack, and other casino games to people within the state over the internet. However, there are a number of restrictions in place.

First, only residents of New Jersey will be able to play. Second, players must be physically located in New Jersey at the time they are playing. This means that people in other states will not be able to participate in New Jersey's online gambling market.

Third, only licensed Atlantic City casinos will be allowed to offer online gambling services. This excludes many of the smaller casinos in the state. Finally, online gambling will be subject to the same age restriction as land-based gambling: 21 and older.

Supporters of the law say that it will help revive Atlantic City's struggling casino industry. They predict that it will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for the city and its casinos.

Critics argue that the law is too restrictive and will not be successful in attracting players from other states. They point out that Delaware, which also legalized online gambling earlier this year, has not seen a significant increase in tourism or revenue.

#  NJ Legislature Approves Bill Allowing Online Gambling

On Monday, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill that would legalize online gambling within the state. The vote was unanimous, with both chambers of the legislature approving the measure.

The bill now goes to Governor Chris Christie for his signature. Christie has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is believed to be supportive of it. If Christie signs the bill, online gambling will become legal in New Jersey as early as this fall.

Under the terms of the bill, only licensed casinos in New Jersey would be allowed to offer online gambling services. These casinos would be able to offer a variety of games, including blackjack, slots, and poker.

The bill also includes a number of safeguards to protect consumers. For example, players would be required to set deposit limits and would be prohibited from betting more than $10 per hand. In addition, casinos would be required to verify players' identities before allowing them to gamble online.

Casino executives have been lobbying for years for legislation legalizing online gambling in New Jersey. They argue that it will allow them to compete with casinos in other states that have already legalized internet gaming, such as Nevada and Delaware.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, supporters say that these risks are no greater than those associated with traditional casino gambling.
