#  Neymar scores four goals as PSG beats Monaco at the blackjack table 

Neymar Jr is on fire. The Brazilian superstar, who became the world's most expensive player when he joined PSG from Barcelona for a staggering €222 million last summer, continued his goal-scoring streak for the Parisian side by netting four times in a 5-1 demolition of Monaco on Sunday.

The spectacular performance takes Neymar's tally to 10 goals in just six Ligue 1 appearances this season – more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues. He is also the first player in PSG history to score in each of the club's first six league games.

It was a particularly sweet victory for Neymar against his former team, Monaco – the club that originally signed him as a 13-year-old prospect from Santos before selling him to Barcelona four years later.

"It was an amazing game," Neymar said after the match. "I'm very happy with the goals and with the victory."

PSG boss Unai Emery was equally effusive in his praise for his star man. "He's always there when needed," Emery said. "He makes a difference."

Neymar wasn't the only one on target against Monaco, with Julian Draxler and Angel Di Maria also scoring for PSG. But it was the Brazilian's night, and he will doubtless be looking to continue his scintillating form when PSG take on Bayern Munich in the Champions League next Wednesday.

#  Kylian Mbappé becomes first teenager to score hat-trick in blackjack table match 

He is known as one of the best footballers in the world and Kylian Mbappé didn't let us down as he became the first teenager to score a hat-trick in a blackjack table match.

The French striker played for France in the World Cup and was part of the team that won the trophy. 

Kylian Mbappé's record-breaking performance took place at Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco. 

Mbappé, who is only 20 years old, scored three times within 17 minutes – something that had never been done before at this casino. 

Casino officials say that this was an "incredible" accomplishment and they are now looking into ways to create new records for Mbappé. 

He is considered one of the most promising young talents in world football and his extraordinary skills have already won him multiple awards. 

In addition to being a successful footballer, Mbappé is also a successful businessman. In 2017, he signed an endorsement deal with Nike worth €10 million (£9 million). 

Mbappé's current contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires in June 2022 and it is likely that he will sign a new contract with the club soon.

#  Edinson Cavani grabs brace as PSG extends perfect record at blackjack table 

In spite of Neymar’s absence and with Kylian Mbappé starting on the bench, Edinson Cavani was decisive for PSG as the team managed to win their fourth game in Ligue 1 this season. The Uruguayan striker grabbed a brace in the first half, making the difference in an encounter that could have ended in a draw.

PSG can thank Cavani for his goals, but they will also need to keep an eye on their defence. With Marco Verratti out injured, Thomas Tuchel had to improvise in midfield and it showed at times. Nevertheless, with their 100% record still intact, PSG will travel to Liverpool for their first match of the Champions League group stage next week full of confidence.

#  Layvin Kurzawa winner gives PSG seventh successive victory at blackjack table 

PARIS (Reuters) - Layvin Kurzawa became the latest Paris St Germain player to win at the blackjack table on Sunday, the seventh consecutive player to do so, as the Ligue 1 leaders extended their unbeaten run to 16 games.

After a goalless first half at the Parc des Princes, Angel Di Maria gave PSG the lead with his 10th league goal of the season shortly after the interval.

Kurzawa then made it 2-0 with a thumping header and Julian Draxler made it 3-0 with a clever chip over goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier.

Fabinho's late penalty completed the scoring as PSG moved 11 points clear at the top of the table.

"We can always do better but we're in good shape and we want to stay like that until the end of the season," said Draxler. "We've been winning for a long time now and that's very positive for us."

Since November last year, seven different PSG players have won at the blackjack table: Neymar, Dani Alves, Adrien Rabiot, Marquinhos, Edinson Cavani, Kylian Mbappe and now Layvin Kurzawa.

#  Marco Verratti shows his class with virtuoso performance against Monaco

Paris Saint-Germain were in imperious form on Sunday night as they recorded a 5-1 victory over Monaco in Ligue 1. Marco Verratti was the star of the show, putting in a superb performance to help his side take all three points.

The Italian midfielder was at the heart of everything good about PSG’s play, dictating the tempo and marshalling the midfield with authority. He showed great poise and technique on the ball, repeatedly finding space in between the lines and spraying visionary passes across the pitch.

Verratti’s passing accuracy was an impressive 97%, and he also managed two assists for Edinson Cavani. It was an all-round masterful display from one of Europe’s most talented young midfielders, and it left Monaco with absolutely no answers.

This season has seen Verratti emerge as one of PSG’s most important players, and he is now starting to make a name for himself on the European stage. He has been key to their unbeaten start to the season, and it is clear that he is destined for big things in the future.

With Verratti in this kind of form, PSG are a force to be reckoned with and look like clear favourites to win Ligue 1 once again.
