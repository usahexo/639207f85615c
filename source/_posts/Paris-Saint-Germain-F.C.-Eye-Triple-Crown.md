#  Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Eye Triple Crown

It would be a massive understatement to say that Paris Saint-Germain F.C. is having a good season.PSG currently leads the French Ligue 1 table by a whopping 16 points and look destined for a domestic treble, with only the Coupe de France standing in their way.

But PSG’s ultimate ambition is grander than just domestic domination – they want to conquer Europe. And they may just be on course to do so, as they sit 2nd in their Champions League group, behind Spanish giants Barcelona but ahead of Tottenham Hotspur and Inter Milan.

To win the Champions League, PSG will have to overcome some of Europe’s top teams, but there’s no reason why they can’t do it. After all, they have some of the world’s best players in their ranks, including Neymar Jr., Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe.

So far this season, PSG have been in irresistible form, scoring goals for fun and winning virtually every match they’ve played. If they can keep up this level of performance until May, they could well be crowned European champions.

Here’s hoping they make it all the way to the final and lift the trophy!

#  PSG Could Secure A Place In Champions League Quarter-Finals

Paris Saint-Germain will be looking to secure their place in the Champions League quarter-finals when they take on Manchester United at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening.

The reigning Ligue 1 champions hold a 2-0 advantage from the first leg of this last-16 clash, and they will be confident of completing the job at United’s home ground.

PSG have been in impressive form in Europe this season, winning all five of their group games to finish top of Group A. They then saw off Real Madrid in the last 16, and they will be eyeing up a place in the semi-finals.

Manchester United, meanwhile, have had a disappointing campaign in Europe and were knocked out at the group stage. They do have form on their side, however, as they knocked out defending champions Barcelona in the previous round.

The Red Devils come into this game on the back of a 3-1 victory over Southampton in the Premier League, and they will be looking to cause an upset against PSG.

PSG are favourites to win this tie but Manchester United cannot be discounted, particularly given their recent record against Spanish opposition.

#  Cavani Nets brace in 3-1 win over Nantes as PSG maintain Ligue 1 lead

Edinson Cavani netted a brace as Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) maintained their lead with a 3-1 win over Nantes on Saturday.

Neymar gave PSG the lead in the first half before Cavani doubled their advantage after the break. Lucas Lima pulled a goal back for Nantes, but Cavani sealed the victory late on.

The result means that PSG remain six points clear at the top of the table, with second-placed Marseille still to play later on Saturday.

#  Neymar Jr Scores Twice As Paris St Germain Extend Their unbeaten Run In Ligue 1 To Seventeen Matches

Neymar Jr opened the scoring for Paris St Germain in their Ligue 1 clash against Montpellier on Saturday. The Brazilian superstar doubled his tally in the second half as the French champions maintained their unbeaten run in the league with a 3-0 win.

With that victory, PSG extended their unbeaten streak in Ligue 1 to seventeen matches and moved five points clear of second-placed Marseille. Neymar Jr has now scored eighteen goals in all competitions for PSG this season.

The former Barcelona forward was at his best against Montpellier and opened the scoring in the nineteenth minute with a sublime free-kick. He then netted again just after the hour mark with a left-footed strike from outside the penalty area.

Angel Di Maria sealed the victory for PSG with a late goal and they now look well on course to defend their Ligue 1 title.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain are also believed to be keen on signing Juventus midfielder Blaise Matuidi this summer.

Matuidi has been one of Juventus' most important players in recent years and he is likely to attract interest from a number of top clubs this summer.

It remains to be seen whether Paris Saint-Germain will be able to complete either of these deals before the start of the new season, but they appear to be determined to make some big signings this summer.
