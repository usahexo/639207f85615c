#  How to Make a Killing Betting on NFL Football 

In today’s age, the popularity of NFL Football cannot be denied. This is especially true when it comes to gambling and betting on the NFL. Here are a few tips to help make money on NFL Football gambling:

1. Start by doing your research – This is probably the most important piece of advice. There are many different ways to bet on NFL games, so it is important to know what each one entails. Make sure you understand the odds for each type of bet, and which ones offer the best chance to win money.

2. Try to avoid risky bets – While it can be tempting to bet on big favorites or underdogs, these bets come with a lot of risk. The odds are usually lower when betting on big favorites, while underdog bets have a higher chance of losing. Instead, try to stick with more middle-of-the-road bets that have a better chance of winning.

3. Use proper bankroll management – This is another key factor in winning money betting on NFL games. Make sure you only gamble what you can afford to lose, and never bet more than you can comfortably lose. That way, if things don’t go your way, you won’t end up in too much trouble financially.

4. Follow the news and other betting trends – Keeping up with the latest news and betting trends can give you an edge over the competition. Just make sure not to get too caught up in all the hype; use sound judgement when placing your bets.

5. Have fun! – Gambling should be enjoyable, so don’t stress out if you lose some money along the way. Just keep trying to learn as much as possible and make smart bets, and eventually you will start seeing profits.

#  Giants Fans Feeling Confident About the Upcoming Season 

The Giants are coming into the 2017 season with a lot of momentum after making it to the playoffs last year. Many fans are feeling confident that they can make it all the way to the Super Bowl this year.

There are many reasons for the Giants' optimism this year. One of their biggest strengths is their passing game, which was one of the best in the league last year. Eli Manning is coming off of a great season, and he has some talented receivers to throw to, including Odell Beckham Jr. and Brandon Marshall.

The Giants also have a strong defense, which helped them win a lot of close games last year. They have several talented players on that side of the ball, including Landon Collins and Olivier Vernon.

Of course, there are always question marks going into any season, and the Giants are no exception. One potential issue is their offensive line, which is inexperienced and could struggle early on in the season.

Overall, however, there's a lot to be excited about with this Giants team. They have everything they need to make a run at the Super Bowl this year, and their fans are feeling confident about their chances.

#  NY State Assemblyman Proposes Bill to Legalize Sports Betting 

On Monday, New York State Assemblyman Gary Pretlow introduced a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The proposed legislation would regulate and tax sports betting, which is currently illegal in New York.

“It is time to bring this multibillion-dollar industry out of the shadows and into the sunlight, where it can be properly monitored and regulated,” Pretlow said in a statement.

If the bill passes, New York would join Nevada as the only states where sports betting is legal. The proposed legislation would establish a nine percent tax on gross gaming revenue for casinos and racetracks that offer sports betting.

The state Gaming Commission would be responsible for regulating the industry. Sports betting operators would be required to pay licensing fees and submit to background checks.

Representatives from the casino industry have voiced support for the proposed legislation, saying it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state. They contend that sports betting can be safely regulated and monitored.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and organized crime activities. They also maintain that the state should not legalize an activity that is currently illegal under federal law.

The proposed bill comes as New York lawmakers are scrambling to fill a $4 billion budget gap. Pretlow said he believes taxing legalized sports betting could generate substantial revenue for the state.
