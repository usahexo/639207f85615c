#  Dragon Scrolls coming back with a vengeance

Dragon Scrolls, the popular role-playing game that was once a sensation on mobile devices is making a comeback!

The original Dragon Scrolls was released in 2014 and became an instant hit with gamers around the world. The premise of the game is simple but exciting – you play as a dragon and your objective is to collect as many scrolls as possible while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The gameplay is fast-paced and exciting, and the graphics are top-notch.

Now, the developers of Dragon Scrolls have announced that they will be releasing a new version of the game called Dragon Scrolls: Vengeance. The new version promises to be even better than the original, with more levels, more challenges, and better graphics.

In addition to the new version of the game, the developers have also announced that they will be releasing a new novel set in the world of Dragon Scrolls. The novel will tell the story of how the main character, Alex, became a dragon and embarked on his quest to collect scrolls.

 Fans of Dragon Scrolls are sure to be excited about this news, and we can’t wait to see what else the developers have in store for us!

#  Gambling addict spends all his money on chance to win back lost Dragon Scrolls money

A young man addicted to gambling has admitted spending all his money in a desperate bid to win back cash he lost betting on Dragon Scrolls.

The 22-year-old, who wishes to remain anonymous, said he had gambled away £2,000 in the space of just two weeks playing the online game.

In a final bid to recoup his losses, he emptied his bank account and spent all his savings on betting on the game.

"I was convinced that if I put in just one more bet, I would get my money back and be able to pay my rent," he said. "But of course that didn't happen."

He added: "I know it was stupid and I shouldn't have done it but at the time I just couldn't help myself. It's like the game was drawing me in."

The man is one of many people whose lives have been ruined by gambling addiction. According to statistics from the Gambling Commission, problem gamblers lost a total of £1.5bn between April 2015 and March 2016.


  The increasing popularity of gambling websites and apps is thought to be behind the rise in addiction rates, with around 2 million people in Britain believed to be at risk of developing a problem. The NHS defines gambling addiction as "an illness that causes someone to keep betting even though they know they're going to lose". 

  Symptoms can include lying about how much money has been lost or stolen, borrowing money from family and friends, selling possessions, and skipping work or college in order to gamble. Financial problems are often one of the main consequences of gambling addiction, as addicts will often use whatever money they have to place bets. 

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can ruin lives, but there is help available. Organizations such as GamCare offer support and advice for people affected by gambling addiction, while treatment clinics can help those struggling to overcome their addiction.
