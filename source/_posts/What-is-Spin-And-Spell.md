#  What is Spin And Spell?

Spin And Spell is a new game that is currently being developed by the independent game developer, Shannon Platt. The game is set to be released in late 2019 on the PC and Mac platforms. Spin And Spell is an educational spelling game where players must use their finger to spin a wheel of letters to spell words.

The game consists of 12 different levels, with each level becoming more difficult than the last. In each level, players are given 20 seconds to spell as many words as possible. At the end of the level, players are awarded points based on how many words they were able to spell and how difficult those words were.

In addition to the 12 main levels, there are also 3 bonus levels that can be unlocked by collecting all of the letters in a word. There are also 3 different modes that can be played: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. In each mode, the words get progressively harder to spell.

One of the things that makes Spin And Spell stand out from other spelling games is its unique gameplay mechanic. Players must use their finger to spin a wheel of letters in order to spell words. This mechanic makes the game more interactive and engaging than other games that require players to simply type in words.

Another thing that sets Spin And Spell apart is its beautiful hand-drawn graphics. The graphics give the game a charming and retro feel that will appeal to gamers of all ages.

Overall, Spin And Spell is shaping up to be one of the most unique and engaging spelling games ever made. If youâ€™re looking for a fun and challenging spelling game that looks great too, then Spin And Spell is definitely worth checking out!

#  Does Spin And Spell have a mobile app?

The short answer is no, Spin And Spell doesn't have a mobile app. However, the site does work well on mobile devices and there's no need for a separate app.

Simply visit the Spin And Spell website on your smartphone or tablet and you'll be able to use all of the features of the site. The site has been designed to work well on all devices, so you'll have no problem using it on the go.

There are a few reasons why we haven't released a mobile app yet. Firstly, it can be expensive to develop an app and secondly, not everyone uses apps. Many people still prefer to use websites on their phone or tablet.

#  What are the rules of Spin And Spell?

Created by game designer Jay Majer, Spin and Spell is a new tabletop game that is easy to learn but provides a challenging game experience. The game consists of a spinner with letters on it and players take turns spinning the letter and then spelling words from the letters shown. The first player to spell a word using all of the letters on the spinner wins the round.

The rules are simple - spin the spinner and spell a word. But there are a few things to keep in mind:

- You can only use each letter once per word
- The player with the most letters at the end of the game wins
- If you can't spell a word, you lose your turn
